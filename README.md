# vue-tone-synth

> A Vue.js project

This is a vue.js monophonic synthesizer using Tone.js for the audio synthesis. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```
* Note: for the import of keypress.js in the project, it may be necessary to change the "main" argument in the keypress.js package.json*

Like so:
``` json

"main": "keypress-2.1.4.min.js",

```

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
``` bash
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
